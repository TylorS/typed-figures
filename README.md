# Typed Figures

A small set of well-typed, in TypeScript, strings that you can't type on a normal
keyboard. The beautiful thing about the types is they show you what it represents.

This is an extremely simple codebase, and it documents itself, please see the
source code to see what figures are available.

```TypeScript
import { pointer } from 'typed-figures';

console.log(pointer);
```
